# howyoufeelin

“How You Feelin’” is a Girls Who Code project created by girls in seventh and eighth grade at Explorer Middle School. The project seeks to help encourage and support students with uplifting quotes and challenges compelling the user to go out of their comfort zone.

Over the course of two years, we had to work as a team and combine all of our ideas and individual skills in order to make this program possible. We found it really important for everyone to be kind to one another and find happiness themselves, especially in such a difficult time period in one’s life, and we hope this program can help fellow grade schoolers.
